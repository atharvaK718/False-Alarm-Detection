# False-Alarm-Detection
This project was for a chemical factory with sensors to detect harmful H2S gas. When a leak is detected, alarms alert workers, prompting a response team to sanitize the area and check for leaks, resulting in high costs for the company. Reducing false alarms and enhancing detection is crucial to lower these expenses.
